# Transcription-using-Whisper-and-Deepseek
This repository tries to improve the accuracy of transcription by combining Whisper with WebRTC Voice Activity Detector and DeepSeek. The goal is to figure out a way to use the power of general speech pauses for separating out sentences and an LLM for grammar correction to correct any mistakes that transcription might have.
